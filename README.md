WTA-Project
===========

A simple address book. 

It has the following functionality:
- Users can create an account and identify with an organization
- Users can search other organizations and users
- If user can edit organization info if user belongs to organization
  - user can edit other users belonging to same organization
- If user is not logged in, user can only search and view organization info.
  - User cannot search or view other user info
  - User cannot edit any info
  

***************************

Final Results:

100% functionality
- Everything is Ajaxed.
- Things operate smoothly

Potential additions / changes to do:
- Change the validation errors output to Foundations built in aspects.
- Integrate Google Maps API so that when users click on an address, it pulls up a modal with a map of that location. 
- Change validation code to a third party plugin that is more secure ( Oauth,TankAuth,IonAuth were suggested ).

I'm rather pleased with this wee project.

No known bugs.
